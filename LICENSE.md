## Additional Clause for Commercial Use and Intellectual Framework Protection

In addition to the standard Apache 2.0 terms, the following clause applies to **DAIS‑10 Mini** and all associated intellectual assets:

### **DAIS‑10 Intellectual Framework Clause**

The following items are considered part of the protected intellectual framework of this project and are included under this license:

- **DAIS (Deterministic Artificial Intelligence System)**
- **DAIS‑10 doctrine, philosophy, and vision**
- **All mathematical models, scoring formulations, and deterministic evaluation logic**
- **All theoretical constructs, naming conventions, and conceptual frameworks**
- **All derivative theories, including DIGrS‑10, KAD Theory, BLoC, and related system‑physics formulations**

Commercial use is permitted **only under the following conditions**:

1. **Attribution Requirement**  
   Any commercial use, integration, or redistribution must include clear attribution to:  
   **“DAIS‑10 Mini — Dr. Usman Zafar”**  
   in documentation, UI references, or product materials where applicable.

2. **No Misrepresentation**  
   Commercial entities may not claim ownership, authorship, or origin of the DAIS‑10 philosophy, theory, models, or system‑physics constructs.

3. **No Derivative Framework Rebranding**  
   You may not rebrand, rename, or repurpose the DAIS‑10 theoretical components as a new proprietary framework without explicit written permission from the author.

4. **Permitted Extensions**  
   Extensions, wrappers, or integrations built on top of DAIS‑10 Mini are allowed, provided they:
   - Maintain attribution,
   - Do not obscure or replace the DAIS‑10 identity,
   - Do not imply certification, compliance, or regulatory endorsement unless explicitly granted.

5. **Non‑Compliance**  
   Any commercial use that violates these conditions constitutes a breach of license and terminates the rights granted under the Apache 2.0 license.

---

## Summary

DAIS‑10 Mini remains open‑source under Apache 2.0, but the **DAIS‑10 doctrine, philosophy, theory, and mathematical models are explicitly protected**. Commercial use is allowed with attribution and without misrepresentation or rebranding of the underlying intellectual framework.
